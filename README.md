### Background
I use a so-called balcony power plant with an output of 600Wp on my balcony. Even when I'm working from home in the sunshine and my screens and laptop are running, I produce more electricity than I consume. As the electricity from a balcony power plant, unlike a regular PV system, is not remunerated, I want to store this surplus electricity to charge my cell phone, tablet, smartwatch or laptop in the evening.

### Concept
Battery in a box, charged via a laboratory power supply which is controlled by a Raspberry Pi via a serial interface. An inverter at the output to charge laptops and cell phones. This is intended to store surplus and unremunerated electricity from the balcony power plant.
